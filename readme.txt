This directory contains a bunch of useful scripts for Auto Hot Keys.

Most of these scripts were created/adapted or copied in the last 10 years. They were all created to facilitate my life and on the beginning not intended to public use. So documentation is scarce and they may not make a lot of sense outside the environment they were originally intended to use.

Other scripts were downloaded form the AHK site and kept intact.

At some point I will (try) to update the information and make it more user friendly. For know, I finished translating the majority of the text to English.

Scripts I think will be more useful to others:

Paste Paint
	Script copies the image from active window to the clipboard, opens Paint and paste the image there

Turn CapsLock off
	Self-explanatory

Paste Plain Text
	In any software, paste the copied text as plain text
